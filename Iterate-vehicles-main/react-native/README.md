## How to use Prettier?

#### _"Prettier is an opinionated code formatter"_

### You can integrate Prettier to several IDEs, like [Visual Studio Code](vscode:extension/esbenp.prettier-vscode)

### Or you can run Prettier in the project with

> `npx prettier --write .`

#### This might take some time since it runs Prettier for the whole project
